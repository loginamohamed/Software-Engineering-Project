Online Education Platform Proposal

After the Corona crisis, the trend began to grow towards digital transformation and artificial intelligence, and this led to a focus on other problems that witnessed the launch of this integrated educational system that works remotely.

The “Online Education Platform” is a system aimed more at students to help them overcome their problems as:

1- Going to private course centers and encountering their unknown source and not being accredited, which often leads to fraud.

2- Booking courses far from the student’s place of residence, which costs him transportation, time, and effort back and forth.

3- Paying a lot of money for one course, as the centers exploit students and periodically demand that they pay fees for notes and additional classes and double the prices.

4- The student’s inability to express his opinion and criticize, as some course centers expel those who do not adapt to the strict rules set by the lecturer and his assistants.


5- The limited courses and the lack of diversity in lecturers in the place where the student lives, which forces the student to book with them despite their lack of competence.

6- Lack of periodic follow-up and evaluation of the student’s level.

7- Lack of availability of many areas to develop the student’s skills.

8- There are no recordings of the courses he attends, as whenever a student wants to remember a lecture, he cannot.

These problems are due to the so-called traditional system, and this is what our system, the “Online Education Site,” was born for.

The “Online Education Platform” works to provide a healthy educational environment for the student in terms of:

1- Distance education: where the student can join the platform and begin his journey in education, which relieves him of the problem of transportation and wasted time, effort, and cost.

2- Freedom to choose the course and the lecturer who lectures: By providing each course with more than one teacher with different competencies, levels, and teaching methods, which makes it easier for the student to choose what suits him.

3- Recommendations: The student will be able to see the most popular or highly rated courses, which will make it easier for the student to be reassured about the competence of the lecturer and his teaching method.

4- Freedom of opinion and constructive criticism: Providing ways for the student to express his comments and write them, whether in public or communicating privately and requesting assistance from officials and supervisors.

5- Availability of the course at any time: The student enables the student to save the videos and return to them whenever he wants, with the same quality.

6- It provides many different fields and materials to develop skills, whether technical or soft.

7- Follow your interactions on the platform.

So, in brief, this system works to transform the traditional education system into a developed technical education system of high quality and efficiency that is in the interest of the learner.
